> [!info] 2026-03-25: WS12 Phase 3 — Panel Full-Screen (IN PROGRESS, unresolved)
> **What was done:**
> - Diagnosed Block 1 (Phase 2) vs Block 2 (WS12) conflict on `.inbox-sidebar`: `max-height: 45vh`, `min-height: 220px`, `margin: 8px`, `border-radius: 16px` were not cleared in Block 2
> - Added `max-height: unset`, `min-height: unset`, `margin: 0`, `border-radius: 0` to `.inbox-sidebar` Block 2 rule in `_styles_layout.html`
> - Push tested — panels still not filling full screen; root cause not yet resolved
> **Suspects for next session:**
> - `#main-workspace` height: `calc(100svh - 84px - 80px)` — `svh` unit may not be supported in GAS iframe context; try fallback to `100vh` or explicit `height: 100%` + flex on body
> - `position: absolute; inset: 0` may not be resolving because `#main-workspace` context is `display: block` without correct height propagation from body
> - JS IIFE timing — runs at end of body, but styles may not have fully applied when `display: flex` is set
> - Additional CSS conflict not yet located — need fresh audit of all desktop `.inbox-sidebar` base rules
> **Files changed:** `_styles_layout.html`
> **Phase 3 status:** 🔄 STILL IN PROGRESS

> [!info] 2026-03-24: WS11 Complete — Visual Redesign Pass (Mobile)
> **Phases completed (all smoke tested):**
> - Phase 1: Transition token standardization — `--transition-fast`/`--transition-std` in `_styles_base.html`; all durations normalized in `_styles_mobile.html`
> - Phase 2: Drill-down slide animation — `slideInFromRight` keyframe on Queue → Detail via `openQueueDetail()` + `animationend` cleanup
> - Phase 3: Flag badge class reconciliation — `buildFlagBadges()` wired on queue cards (`_render_queue_card.html`) and detail view; `flag-badge--admin` severity added; `flag-badge` CSS added to `_styles_mobile.html`
> - Phase 4: Typography upgrade — Fira Code loaded via `<link>` in MobileApp.html; `--font-mono` token applied to `.queue-card__fdh`, `.detail-title`, `.detail-kpi__value`, `.detail-value`
> - Phase 5: Dark mode 3-level card depth — `--card-bg: #18181b`, `--card-bg-2: #27272a`, `--card-bg-3: #09090b`, `--border: #3f3f46` in `body.dark-mode` of `_styles_mobile.html`
> - Phase 6: WebApp.html cutover — ⛔ ABORTED mid-session. Desktop broke. Reverted. Desktop queue renderer (email-card/DOM nodes) is architecturally separate — requires dedicated desktop WS.
> - Phase 7: Digest chart depth — gradient fill bars + inset track shadow in `_styles_mobile.html`
>
> **Key lessons:**
> - During a mobile-scoped visual pass, NEVER touch WebApp.html, _module_queue_state.html, or _styles_components.html. Desktop queue renderer is separate architecture.
> - "Deferred cutover" notes in WORKSTREAM_0_NOTES.md are not authorization to touch desktop files mid-workstream.
>
> **Deferred to WS12:** Haptic polish (`navigator.vibrate(10)` on commit/confirm), WebApp.html card builder cutover (dedicated desktop WS), presentation/theater mode on mobile
>
> **Commit:** refactor(ws11) — 6 of 7 phases, March 24, 2026

> [!info] 2026-03-24: WS10 Complete — Mobile Feature Parity + Shared Rendering Architecture
> **Phases completed (all smoke tested):**
> - Phase 1: Gantt quick peek (slide-up sheet, drag dismiss)
> - Phase 2: Gemini on mobile (draft, AI peek, save note)
> - Phase 3: Shared utility partials (DRY pass, _utils_shared.html wired on mobile)
> - Phase 4: Queue view modes (List + Grid)
> - Phase 5: KPI HUD strip
> - Phase 6: Critical Hub
> - Phase 7: Changelog / Review Hub
> - Phase 8: Deck workspace
> - Phase 9: State contract alignment — mobileState.all/filtered/activeItem retired; allActionItems/filteredItems/currentActiveItem now shared via _state_queue/_state_session includes
> - Phase 10: Shared rendering primitives — _render_status_pill.html, _render_flag_badge.html, _render_queue_card.html extracted
>
> **Key lessons:**
> - Mobile flag rendering uses queue-flag/detail-flag classes — buildFlagBadges() call-site swap deferred to WS11 class reconciliation
> - _render_queue_card.html wired to MobileApp.html only; WebApp.html cutover deferred to WS11
> - askGeminiForDraft / askGeminiForQuickPeek are desktop-only wrappers — correct backend calls are generateAndSaveFDHNarrative() and saveDeckAnswers()
>
> **Deferred to WS11:** flag badge class reconciliation, WebApp.html card builder cutover, transition standardization, drill-down slide animation, typography (Fira Code), 3-level card depth
>
> **Commit:** refactor(ws10) — all 10 phases, March 24, 2026
